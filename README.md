Practice creating repositories on Github

I created this repository to practice creating repositories and uploading my codes to github.

Included in this repository is a code I did for a practice problem. The assignment was to create a simple vending machine that keeps track of orders, doesnt checkout until the 
user is ready, and gives a total at the end.
